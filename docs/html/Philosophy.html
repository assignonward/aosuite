<h2>Motivations</h2>

<a href="Applications.html">Who</a> <a href="Goals.html">what</a> <a href="Roadmap.html">when</a> and <a href="Architecture.html">how</a> are covered elsewhere.  Where is anywhere with internet access.  But: <i>why?</i>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/thousands-of-cryptocurrency-projects-are-already-dead/">Over</a> <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/more-than-1000-cryptocurrency-projects-have-failed-in-2018/">1000</a> cryptocurrency / blockchain projects have already failed; yes, but their primary focus was raising money.  <a href="https://ripple.com/">Major</a> <a href="https://ethereum.org/">blockchain</a> <a href="https://eos.io/">innovation</a> <a href="https://getmonero.org/">projects</a> with strong backing and well developed ideas abound; yes, but their goals include focusing an income stream back to the controlling investors.  <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> made <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-chicken-and-egg-blockchain-existed-before-bitcoin">blockchain</a> popular through accessibility: anyone with a PC and internet access could participate in the early network and earn Bitcoins in exchange for their participation.  As its popularity grew, the cost to meaningfully participate increased, today <a href="https://shop.bitmain.com/">specialized</a> <a href="https://www.bitcoinmining.com/">hardware</a> using <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">significant</a> <a href="https://powercompare.co.uk/bitcoin/">amounts</a> of <a href="https://qz.com/1281850/bitcoins-energy-consumption-is-as-much-a-year-as-all-of-ireland-says-the-first-peer-reviewed-study-on-the-subject/">electricity</a> is required to profitably participate, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoin-fees-are-skyrocketing/">transaction</a> <a href="http://moneyandstate.com/the-true-cost-of-bitcoin-transactions/">fees</a> are growing.  <a href="https://www.bitcoincash.org/">Many</a> <a href="https://litecoin.org/">projects</a> <a href="https://www.dash.org/">aim</a> to <a href="https://www.iota.org/">reduce</a> transaction costs, but they are still being developed by investors with profit as a primary motive.  Assign Onward is conceived for grassroots development, aiming to be useful and grow without requiring significant financial backing,<div class="tooltip"><sup>1</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Assign Onward is <a href="Transparency.html">open source, open license</a>, so, if an investment firm wants to use all or part of the Assign Onward concepts and code in a project of their direction, they are free to do so.</span></div> hopefully recapturing some of the early Bitcoin enthusiasm for a project that individuals can profit in by participating.

<h3>Save the planet</h3>

A large part of what took Bitcoin out of the hands of individuals was the <a href="ProofOfWork.html">Proof Of Work</a> component and the costs that it eventually created.  Proof of work provides decentralized trust based on the expense of computation.  Assign Onward replaces this decentralized trust with the established <a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/pgp-web-trust-core-concepts-behind-trusted-communication">Web Of Trust</a> used by <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/">PGP</a> and in so doing it tremendously reduces the infrastructure and power requirements to securely process transactions, thereby removing the capital-intensive barriers to entry that Bitcoin and other highly developed projects have grown, and incidentally processing transactions for a tiny fraction of the power demands of a secure Proof Of Work based blockchain.

<h3>Simplicity of implementation</h3>

Rather than building ever more complex<div class="tooltip"><sup>2</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and buggy</span></div> layers of application interfaces, security protocols, etc. Assign Onward <a href="Roadmap.html">focuses</a> on simple concepts and <a href="Goals.html">attempts</a> to describe their functionality as simply, securely, and flexibly as possible.  The hope is that a simple implementation can be more readily understood and adopted by a wide variety of users and developers.

<h3>The power of participation</h3>

If Assign Onward enables small business owners and individuals to set up their own blockchain systems that they control and derive value from as DIY projects, then it has succeeded.<div class="tooltip"><sup>3</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and if it is scaled up and also used by large transaction processors, so much the better.</span></div>  Interoperability between these DIY blockchains<div class="tooltip"><sup>4</sup><span class="tooltiptext">including practical trust and security models</span></div> is where I can see Assign Onward becoming a significant part in the future of trusted exchange of contracts and records.  No single blockchain system can, nor should even <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-as-a-prime-example-of-blockchain-before-bitcoin-policy">try</a>, to rule the world.  Millions, perhaps billions, of individually controlled blockchain systems voluntarily cooperating, that's the exciting vision.
