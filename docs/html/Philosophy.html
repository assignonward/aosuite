<h2>Motivations</h2>

Assign Onward is conceived for grassroots development, aiming to be useful and grow without requiring significant financial backing,<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Assign Onward is <a href="Transparency.html">open source, open license</a>, so, if an investment firm wants to use all or part of the Assign Onward concepts and code in a project of their direction, they are free to do so.</span></div> hopefully recapturing some of the early Bitcoin enthusiasm for a project that individuals can profit in by participating.

<h3>Save the planet</h3>

A large part of what took Bitcoin out of the hands of individuals was the <a href="ProofOfWork.html">Proof Of Work</a> component and the costs that it eventually created.  Proof of work provides decentralized trust based on the expense of computation.  Assign Onward replaces this decentralized trust with the established <a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/pgp-web-trust-core-concepts-behind-trusted-communication">Web Of Trust</a><div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Ironically, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/ethereum-proof-of-authority-on-azure/">Microsoft</a> is leveraging Ethereum to provide a similar Proof Of Authority system.  I would assume that the largest monopoly in proprietary software history combined with the best funded and largest centralized blockchain development project would be focused on different target audiences than Assign Onward.</span></div> used by <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/">PGP</a> and in so doing it tremendously reduces the infrastructure and power requirements to securely process transactions, thereby removing the capital-intensive barriers to entry that Bitcoin and other highly developed projects have grown, and incidentally processing transactions for a tiny fraction of the power demands of a secure Proof Of Work based blockchain.

<h3>Simplicity of implementation</h3>

Rather than building ever more complex<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and buggy</span></div> layers of application interfaces, security protocols, etc. Assign Onward <a href="Roadmap.html">focuses</a> on simple <a href="Protocols.html">concepts</a> and <a href="Goals.html">attempts</a> to describe their functionality as simply, securely, and flexibly as possible.  The hope is that a simple implementation can be more readily understood and adopted by a wide variety of users and developers.

<h3>The power of participation</h3>

If Assign Onward enables <a href="IslandLife.html">small</a> business owners and individuals to set up their own blockchain systems that they control and derive value from as DIY projects, then it has succeeded.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and if it is scaled up and also used by large transaction processors, so much the better.</span></div>  Interoperability between these DIY blockchains<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">including practical trust and security models</span></div> is where I can see Assign Onward becoming a significant part in the future of trusted exchange of contracts and records.  No single blockchain system can, nor should even <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-as-a-prime-example-of-blockchain-before-bitcoin-policy">try</a>, to rule the world.  Millions, perhaps billions, of individually controlled blockchain systems voluntarily cooperating, that's the exciting vision.

Prioritize your passion. It keeps you sane.<br/>

<h2>Symbology</h2>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cleaver#/media/File:June_and_Ward_Cleaver_Leave_it_to_Beaver_1958.JPG"><img src="JuneAndASignOnWard.PNG" alt="Ⓐ" width="259" height="333" style="float:left" alt="A Sign On Ward"></a>
What's in a name?  Assign Onward was chosen as the project name because it conveyed the central concept of transferring shares from one participant to the next, a vague similarity to the well known meme "Pay it Forward," simplicity of the name, and widespread availability/uniqueness.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">By mid 2018, everything with "coin" in the name was in use - most of them twice.  ArrCoin was briefly considered for the Beatle-like alliteration to Our Coin, a collective... of pirates?  Maybe not the best choice.</span></div>  The A in circle logo was quick and easy to make in <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, and I 3D printed a handful of physical Ⓐ tokens before noticing the similarity to <a href="https://twitter.com/leohallamdawson/status/933118815386337280">J-Bone's forehead tattoo</a> in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/">Johnny Mnemonic</a>.<br/><br/>

So, of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism">Anarchism</a> is a thing, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory)">mutualism</a> has described mutual credit systems for over 150 years, so even though it was unintentional the symbology fits quite well.  Of course, Anarchists have led a rough life with very limited acceptance or success in those 150 years, and I would hope that even if Assign Onward shares much of their philosophy and even symbology, that the Assign Onward systems of personal debt recording and exchange could find more acceptance in the future world than economic mutualism has in the past.  I'll reserve judgement on what should or shouldn't be owned or paid for by whom and on what terms, but I will throw out there that: with the technology available today individuals can make their own credible promises of debt and repayment on their own terms and potentially reap much of the benefit that traditional banking and investment systems took from them, assuming that government regulations support or at least don't stifle these type of systems.
