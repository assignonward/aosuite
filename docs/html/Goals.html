<h4>Seven Sentiments Surrounding Success</h4>
Assign Onward Should Stay:
<ul><li>Simple</li>
    <li>Secure</li>
    <li>Small</li>
    <li>Scalable</li>
    <li>Synchronized</li>
    <li>Shared</li>
    <li>Social</li>
    <li>Serviceable</li>
</ul>

Less lyrically,

<span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="_name1" itemprop="name">Goals</h1>

in rough order of priority:

<ul>
<li>Secure</li>
<ul><li>Establish un-alterable records, including records of title<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Title meaning: ownership of a number of shares which can be divided, or merged when assigning onward.</span></div></li>
    <li>Assignment of title<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Assignment of title means recording a change of ownership of shares from the holder of one secret to the holder of a different secret.</span></div> can only be accomplished with <b>a secret that need never be revealed</b></li>
    <li>Resistant to malicious confusion of records</li>
</ul>
<li>Open (shared), anyone can:</li>
<ul><li>receive or assign title</li>
    <ul><li>receive title under a secret that only they know</li>
        <li>propose assignment of title to any secret known/controlled by another<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Assignment of title requires offer and acceptance, each identity (<a href="BlockchainBasics.html#KeyPairs">public key</a>) can only receive title once, therefore it is required that the holder of the private key accept assignment of title under their public key.</span></div></li>
    </ul>
    <li>obtain all records</li>
    <li>verify validity of all records</li>
    <ul><li>title</li>
        <ul><li>chain of title<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">For any given title to shares, anyone can trace the source(s) of the shares back to the <a href="BlockchainBasics.html#GenesisBlock">genesis block</a>.</span></div></li>
            <li>absence of double spend<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">confirm that title has not been assigned from the record of initial receipt of title through to the recording of assignment of title.</span></div></li>
        </ul>
        <li>recording process</li>
    </ul>
    <li>participate in the recording process<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">by running software that creates, validates, and proposes pages and blocks for inclusion in the <a href="BlockchainBasics.html">blockchain</a>.  This goal will not be addressed for single chains until the Ⓐ² <a href="Protocols.html">protocol</a>, although anyone who wants to can start their own independent Ⓐ¹ blockchain.</span></div></li>
    <li>examine<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">also copy and modify if desired.  Essentially, no dependence on protections like trade secrets, copyright, patent or legislation to secure functionality of the system.</span></div> the computer code that implements the system</li>
</ul>
<li>Accessible</li>
<ul><li>simple, (small) clearly expressed processes, not un-necessarily baffling</li>
    <li>minimize real-world cost of participation (social) in any part of the process</li>
    <ul><li>easy to detect loss of synchronization between recording nodes</li>
    </ul>
    <li>serve the users of the system, not the owners of the infrastructure</li>
    <li>scalable refers to the abilty of multiple chains to interact, serving large numbers of people and transactions not by a single massive system, but by a cooperating network of smaller systems each of which is readily understood and maintained by a single person.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">This doesn't mean a single person should do all the setup and maintenance of each chain by themselves, it's better handled by a team, but on a scale that a single member could easily handle it all if they wanted/needed to.</span></div></li>
    <li>Launch Time: when it's ready.</li>
</ul>
<li>Extensible (serviceable)</li>
<ul><li>interoperability with other systems</li>
    <li>designed for inclusion of or migration to new technologies when desired</li>
    <li>tunable parameters to adjust to changing use conditions</li>
</ul>
</ul>

As with any non-trivial project, several goals are in opposition.  The goal not stated above is to optimize tradeoffs making the system as valuable as possible to users.  Users are the value in the system, the system <a href="Philosophy.html">should</a> return as much of that value as possible to them, encouraging wider adoption and increasing total value.
