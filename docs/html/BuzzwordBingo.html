<h1>Buzzword Bingo</h1>

Assign Onward (Ⓐ) <a href="Goals.html">endeavors to</a> maximize value delivered to individuals.  The Ⓐ ecosystem is<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">envisioned to become</span></div> a mesh of millions of small, open, public value store blockchain issues.  Ⓐ enables anyone, anywhere to establish their own blockchain issue(s).   Individuals are able to operate, control and understand their own blockchain(s).  Direct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">proof of stake</a> exchange<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">secure atomic exchanges recorded on one, two or more blockchains</span></div> between Ⓐ participants allows efficient<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Due to redundancy, transparency, and communication among recorders, reliable blockchain recording is ten to 100x or more costly as compared to simple single point of failure transaction recording, even when using proof of stake.  By controlling their own blockchain individuals control these costs keeping them appropriate for their individual use cases.</span></div> exchanges of value.  Bridges to cryptocurrencies outside the Ⓐ ecosystem provide easy access to those asset pools.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Unfortunately, traditional cryptocurrency transactions incur traditional fees and delays.  The Bitcoin transaction and Ethereum gas fee spikes of 2018 and 2021 underscore the importance of independence.  US$150 to $300 to setup a single Ethereum NFT transaction?  $2 to $50 for a single BTC transaction?  Unacceptable.</span></div>

<h2>Fine Words</h2>

But how?  Trust.  A newly minted open public value store blockchain has zero intrinsic value<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Actually, negative value when you consider the costs of operation.  This is one of many important reasons to abandon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">proof of work</a> as a mechanism to establish trust.</span></div>.  People buy intangible assets to exchange them for something of value in the future.  How can you trust that an unknown asset will be valuable in the future?  You can't.  Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.  No algorithm will protect an unsecured<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and security comes at a high price: legal agreements, taxes to support the courts and police who enforce their judgements, assessment and insurance of collateral.  Unsecured, and under-secured investments have a significant advantage - it's no wonder their average returns are so much higher than "safe" investments that may not even keep pace with inflation.</span></div> investment from the next flash crash.  But, there are many transactions you trust on a daily basis.  When blockchains go grassroots, they enter this realm of local trust.

<h3>Zero Investment</h3>

Zero investment transactions are one realm of safe and easy trust.  When you are buying a sandwich anyway, you have nothing to lose by accepting a free loyalty card.  There is value in the loyalty card, when it has enough credits accrued it is "worth" one free sandwich. Loyalty points issued as transferable tokens are exchangeable for all kinds of value.

<h3>Immediate Payoff</h3>

Another easy trust transaction is one with immediate payoff.  If a merchant accepts a token as payment immediately after you buy it, there's zero holding time.  Zero holding time = immediate gratification = zero risk.  If the merchant is well known to you, you may trust that they will also accept tokens in the future.  With this confidence, you may hold their tokens as a store of value for longer.  You may also sell these tokens you hold long term to others who might turn around and use them immediately.  If you have obtained the tokens at a discount, you can realize a profit while still passing some of that discount on to the zero hold time purchaser.

<h3>Transparency</h3>

Transparency is important.  A merchant might "float" too many tokens on the market relative to their business turnover.  Transparency in accounting should reveal an over-leveraged business before it has a problem.  Tokens of over-leveraged businesses should lose value on the open market.  Tokens of businesses with insufficient transparency should lose value due to that lack.

<h3>Trust Locally - Trade Globally</h3>

Even though you can't sue the neighbor's 14 year old in small claims court, you still might trust them to mow your lawn.  You might even trust them enough to give them an advance payment to buy some equipment.  In the Ⓐ ecosystem, they might give you tokens in exchange, each good for one lawn mowing.  Some 14 year olds end up behaving unreliably<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">this unreliable behavior may, or may not, be the child's fault.  Things beyond their control, things they did not even know were beyond their control, can and do cause failure to deliver on promises for people of all ages.</span></div>, and may want to start over with a new trading identity later.  More reliable<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and/or lucky</span></div> 14 year olds can leverage their history of reliable dealing in the future.  An established history of reliable dealing has value to the owner of that history.  Strangers could blindly trust an unknown identity for a small fraction of its value.  Using trading histories, actuarial tables could characterize the risk of trusting unknown identities based on their trading histories.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">One, of many, examples of how an actuarial table might be fooled would be a wealthy parent buying an existing trading identity for their untrustworthy child.  The child might then turn around and squander the value of that identity by failing to deliver promised value for tokens they sell.  Fortunately, out of character behavior for an identity should be easy to spot and the value of a trustworthy identity is quickly destroyed by bad transactions.  This is why it is important to only trust an identity with a small fraction of its value in any given transaction.</span></div><br/><br/>

For another example, take the classic lemonade stand.  A young entrepreneur might pre-sell tokens for glasses of lemonade to friends for $0.50 each.  Funds from these pre-sales buy the lemonade making supplies.  At the retail sales point, tokens are for sale for $1.00 each.  Unknown customers buy tokens on the open market.  Anyone holding pre-sold tokens might redeem them for lemonade at the stand or sell them for a profit.

<br/><br/>TODO: a new page with a deeper dive on the value and lifecycle of identities

<h3>Distributed Validation</h3>

In some instances, a blockchain owner might choose to process all transactions themselves.  Disadvantages of this approach include:

<ul>
<li>Vulnerabiliy to deliberate attacks:</li>
<ul><li>Denial of service</li>
    <li>Network based server hacking</li>
    <li>Physical attack on the system hardware</li>
    <li>Attack or coersion of the people running the system</li>
</ul>
<li>Vulnerability to unintended faults:</li>
<ul><li>Local infrastructure failure, power or network</li>
    <li>Physical hardware failure</li>
    <li>Software / operating system based data corruption</li>
    <li>Natural events like lightning strike, flood, earthquake, tornado, etc.</li>
</ul>
<li>Administrative failures:</li>
<ul><li>Improper system configuration leading to data corruption/loss</li>
    <li>Inadequate backups to recover from other system faults</li>
    <li>Extended downtime due to poor maintenance planning</li>
    <li>Deliberate failures which may result in users' loss of value</li>
</ul></ul>

<h4>Share the load</h4>

Many issues are addressable by eliminating single points of failure with multiple servers.  Wide geographic distribution of the hardware helps.  Heterogenous hardware / software stacks help prevent single cause system-wide failure.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">When run by a single operator, heterogeneous hardware/software stacks can make things worse by "shallowing" the operator's depth of knowledge about each stack.  Sharing the load across multiple operators enables each to have deep knowledge about the stack they use while allowing the system to benefit from diversity of stacks.</span></div>  Of course, excellent administrative knowledge and integrity is valuable.  In low transaction volume blockchains, all this redundancy means the hardware is underutilized.   Hundreds of server operators can be more efficient serving hundreds of blockchains cooperatively.

<h3>Delegated Proof of Stake</h3>

Elaborate on time limited delegation of shares to cooperating chain builder/validators.
