<h2>Fixed point fractions</h2>

The fixed point fraction concept is likely to be replaced with the GMP multi-precision arithmetic library.
<font color=#AAAAAA>
To ensure repeatability across platforms, shares and coins arithmetic is carried out in fixed point integer, instead of floating point.  The fixedFract data types include an 8 bit exponent which gives the range of shift left +127 (*2^127) to shift right -128 (/2^128).

<h3>Some example shares and coins operations:</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Initial shares: 2^86</LI>
<LI>Coins: 2^33 ~8.6 billion<div class="tooltip"><sup>5</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Coins don't have to total to power of 2 operations, but when they do shift operations can be used instead of multiplication and division.</span></LI>
<LI>Nanocoin: 1/2^30 coins<div class="tooltip"><sup>6</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Roughly one billionth of a coin - recording fees might be as low as one nanocoin per byte.</span></LI>
<LI>Shares Per Coin: N Shares / N Coins, in this example mantissa: N Shares, exponent: 2^-33</LI>
<LI>Shares Per Nanocoin: N Shares / N Coins / 1^30, in this example mantissa: N Shares, exponent: 2^-63</LI>
<LI>Number of shares charged to record a 2568 byte record: 2568 * N Shares >> 63</LI>
<LI>Number of shares in 50 coins: 50 * N Shares >> 33</LI> 
<LI>N shares, expressed in coins: (N shares << 33) / N shares outstanding
</UL>
</font>

Thought: maybe instead of one coin per person in the world, we should target 100,000 coins per person in the world, which would be 2^50ish.  Or, instead of trying to take on the world, we could, instead, target a set of shares to a smaller population, say 100,000 users per genesis block/blockchain, averaging 100,000 coin on the chainshares - this comes back around to the idea of ~10B coins again, or around 2^33 (~8.6B) - and then you'll need on the order of 80,000 value chains to serve the whole world population.

<h3>No Fractional Shares</h3>

2^86 is an extremely large number.  Share calculations that produce fractional results are rounded to the nearest integer.
