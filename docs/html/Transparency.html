<span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><h1 id="_name1" itemprop="name">Transparency</h1><span itemprop="articleBody">

A <a href="CorePrinciples.html">core principle</a> of Assign Onward is transparency:

<ul><li>The protocols are open source<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://github.com/assignonward/aosuite">readily</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/AssignOnward/AssignOnward">available</a>, hopefully well documented source code which can be used to put the protocols into practice</span></div>, open license<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">meaning: anyone is free to practice, operate their own implementation of Assign Onward blockchain protocols.</span></div></li>
    <li>Complete blockchain contents<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">potentially excluding <a href="SeparableItems.html">separable items</a>.</span></div> are readily available to anyone<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">There is a practical balance to strike between openness and vulnerability to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DoS</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming">spam</a> attack.<br/><br/>Nominal transaction fees and/or identity confirmation may become necessary, especially for larger implementations with high monetary or political value.</span></div></li>
</ul>

Protocols and systems designed to layer on top of Assign Onward protocols can assume that they have free access to all<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext"><a href="SeparableItems.html">non-separable</a></span></div> information in any Assign Onward blockchains they are working with.  Likewise they should take into consideration the fact that anyone else may immediately, or at any time in the future, also access all information stored in any Assign Onward blockchain.

<h2>Permanency</h2>

Transparency presents the possibility, but not the guarantee, of permanency.  Generally speaking, as long as a <a href="AssignmentRecorder.html">recorder</a> node operates, it should keep a permanent record of all blockchains it supports.  However, this is only guaranteed as long as the recorder(s) continue to operate and support a blockchain.  If an entity values the information stored in a blockchain, it would be in their best interest to at least keep a copy<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">bits are cheap: hard drives now cost less than $50/TB and SSDs have fallen below $200/TB and continue to drop.  At $200/TB, a 1MB block costs 0.02 cents to store.</span></div> of it for themselves, or perhaps operate an open <a href="AssignmentRecorder.html">recording node</a> of their own.

<h3>On the Social Value of Transparency</h3>

Everything in every openly operated blockchain is available for public inspection. Even separable or encrypted items can be assumed to be revealed at some point - and once revealed<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">No matter how securely a secret key is safeguarded, if it ever gets out in the open, it is essentially out in the open forever.  There is also the issue of technological change / progress which can render once secure secret keys insecure.</span></div> their hash signatures make the items irrefutable in the context of the blockchain records.<br/><br/>

Even though business is nominally conducted in the open today, the cost of collecting detailed information about business operations is prohibitively high for all but the business operators.  Limited information, like sitting in a drug store parking lot counting the number of customers entering the store, is available and sufficient for competitors to estimate the viability of opening a store nearby, but it is not detailed or complete in the way that an open record could potentially be.  Like the transformation in real estate valuation when county record books went online, the cost of collection and analysis of detailed trends will drop dramatically as more and more business information becomes publicly available, whether through the business operators' records, or their customers'.

<h4>Obfuscation</h4>

In the 2011 timeframe, popular (incorrect) opinion held that bitcoin transactions were anonymous.  What they were in reality was obscure, difficult (at the time) to trace, but far from impossible.  After a few well publicized arrests of bitcoin based criminals, <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">new protocols</a> were developed to intentionally "mix" transactions to make them even more difficult to trace.  Similar to<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and sometimes used in conjunction with</span></div> the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> network protocol, transactions are broken up and mixed with others with intermediate records discarded, hoping to break the linkage between the parties doing the transaction, but... unless both parties do a large volume of business with a large number of other parties over the network and are patient enough to wait a long time for their obfuscated transaction to complete, Alice sending Bob $100 at a certain time will always show up as Alice sending $100 and Bob receiving $100 around the same time.

<h4>Regulation</h4>

Imperfect as they may be at keeping transactions completely anonymous, and as many legitimate potential uses as they may have, obfuscation protocols are also undeniably useful money laundering tools - and as such they are early targets for regulation and outright legal bans.  Open, fully transparent protocols may, conversely, be viewed as a positive change by regulators, taxing authorities, etc.

<h4>Automated Accounting</h4>

If large numbers of people and businesses use similar open protocols in similar ways, efficient automated accounting and credit reporting software and services can be developed for all of them.  People and businesses which commit to transacting the bulk of their taxable activity on open blockchain<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">potentially recording evidence of taxable or otherwise reportable non-blockchain transactions on the blockchain to make the record complete</span></div> could automatically create accounting reports, credit reports and tax returns<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">while this degree of financial transparency seems radical in some cultures, in others it is <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/norway/articles/norway-country-public-tax-returns/">perfectly normal</a>.</span></div> for trivial cost.

<h4>Value in Transparency</h4>

As a customer, would you choose to buy an unlabeled apple from a grocery store for $1, or a Honey Crisp apple for $1.10?  Take that a few steps further, what difference in price would you pay for an apple labeled Honey Crisp vs one that is traceable to an openly inspected local farm which follows soil conservation best practices, fair labor practices, uses minimal and certified organic compatible pest control methods, and ten years running award winning best Honey Crisp national competition winner?<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">on the flipside, this level of transparency - for better or for worse - also opens more individual producers to consumer actions like reactionary boycotts.  Some commodity supply chains will likely continue as a safer haven for producers to be able to market their goods without consumer level exposure of the individual producers.  How much the consumers value traceability is yet to be established for sure, but price trends for products with labels like "certified organic" indicate there is some value to be gained.</span></div>  This kind of producer to consumer transparency is <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">starting to be implemented</a> in all kinds of supply chains, not only increasing consumer confidence and value, but also exposing and eliminating previously hidden inefficiencies in supply chains, resulting in impressive cost savings up to 30% and more.<br/><br/>

As a business, would you prefer to issue credit to a customer based on a mostly one-dimensional number issued by a central credit reporting agency, or would you rather have more detailed information about the customer's past<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">while there are legitimate concerns about credit discrimination when transparency is asymmetric, with the business knowing everything about the consumer's history but the consumers knowing nothing about the business' credit issuance decisions, when the business is also transparent with their credit issuance algorithms and actions these can be cheaply and regularly audited for compliance with all legal requirements and even moral and ethical standards.</span></div> financial history?

<h4>Non legally binding credit</h4>

The chief concern of most issuers of credit is the ability, and willingness, of the recipient to repay the loan, on the agreed upon terms.  The current legal system recognizes contracts between competent parties, individuals of legal age and corporations.  When a debtor fails to repay their creditor on terms agreed to in a legally binding document the courts will enforce repayment of the debt through property liens, wage garnishment and even imprisonment of the debtor.  As the late George Carlin famously said about bank penalties, they: "charge you more of what they know you donâ€™t have any of."  This whole system of judges, lawyers, police, etc. is expensive, very expensive when you become entangled in it on the losing end.<br/><br/>

A friend once described an alternative form of money lending from "<a href="https://themobmuseum.org/">the mob</a>."  He was complaining to his personal trainer at the gym about his frustration with banks and the trainer said: "I know a guy, we'll look into it."  The next week he said "they checked you out, your credit is good.  How it works is: you name a number, you will be given a key to a hotel room, in that hotel room will be a briefcase with that much money in it.  A year later, you will return the briefcase with twice as much money in it to another hotel room and your business is done."  My friend declined to accept the offer but apparently if your credit is good, these kinds of offers are still available, if you know a guy.<br/><br/>

In the <a href="IslandLife.html">Island Life</a> story, Eddie extends non legally binding credit to Bob.  Eddie knows, based on his observations of Bob's cash flow, that Bob is able to repay the loan in a timely fashion, and based on his personal relationship with Bob he knows that Bob will honor the debt.  Since the debt is recorded on Bob's active blockchain, Bob is able to repay it in installments: one plate of curry goat at a time.  Eddie resells the debt to Charlie who is in a better position to market it one plate at a time to the tourists he brings from the cruise ship.  This starts as an act of faith in Bob by Eddie, then Charlie, and then as simple transactions between Charlie and Bob's customers who are buying one BCG at a time from Charlie and trading them immediately to Bob for a plate of curry goat.<br/><br/>

With no history, Bob's credit was based on personal relationships and trust.  As a trading history builds up, that history alone demonstrates Bob's credibility and can become a basis of a credit rating for future creditors who may not know Bob so well.  Even without legal status<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">it may be possible to establish legal standing for blockchain based debt in some jurisdictions, it may even happen implicitly under many legal systems, but if a debt backed by the traditional legal system is desired it will likely be easier and more efficient to use the traditional system.  A strong advantage of blockchain based debt is the elimination of legal involvement and all the overhead associated with it.</span></div>, this credit has value to Bob, and like a traditional credit rating - he is unlikely to hurt that credit rating over a small easily repayable debt.  Activity on Bob's blockchain can establish proof<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">measures will have to be taken to ensure cashflow shown on a blockchain represents actual cashflow and not just circular transactions that start and end with the same party, even if that party is participating with multiple other blockchains.</span></div> of cashflow, and the current shares out on the blockchain shows Bob's credit float<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">on that particular blockchain.</span></div>.

<h2>But I don't Like it!</h2>

Like it or not, technology is bringing transparency to modern life.  It has been ever since the invention of writing, and continues through to the ubquitous handheld video recorder.  Machine vision / object recognition, automatic readers, cheap terabyte storage devices, instant global broadband communication... all these things are accelerating transparency in daily life at an alarming rate.  You may choose to keep your financial transactions private, use cash rather than obviously traceable credit cards, calculate your taxes with pencil and paper instead of using the big centralized online accounting apps - but the evidence shows that if you are doing these things in an attempt to protect your financial privacy: A) you are in the minority, and B) it's probably not as effective as you think it is.<br/><br/>

Politicians are unlikely to get elected on "privacy stripping" platforms, so cash is unlikely to go away any time soon, but there are costs associated with cash transactions, consumers have to obtain cash to spend, and businesses have to collect, protect and deposit the cash with banks.  Credit cards collect an obvious tax on every transaction they process, even if they do try to hide this from consumers.  It wouldn't make a lot of sense to transfer title to a family home on a web of trust based blockchain, at least not in today's world, but a sandwich?  Or a bag of groceries?  This is where the web of trust can start, small low risk transactions, and as a history of transparent transactions accumulate, those who have been transparent in their dealings can start to enjoy relief from the credit card and cash overhead, just like credit card users enjoy better credit ratings than cash only people and businesses.
