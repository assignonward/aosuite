<h2>Data Structure</h2>

The data structure is the syntax and grammar of all inter-agent communication in the system.  The choice to be strongly typed should be obvious: different implementations should come up with exactly the same results with minimal room for misinterpretation.  Json objects and arrays are powerfully flexible containers, the addition of strong typing to the concepts makes them a great base for all of the data that needs to be organized and communicated.

<h3>Structure Key Dictionary</h3>

The keys in the key-value pairs of the data are encoded as numbers which both provides an unambiguous sort order for object collections, and a compact form for encoding.  A dictionary establishes translation between the numerical encoding for compact forms and the human readable names that show in json-like representations.

<h2>Protocol Definitions</h2>

Communication, and optionally data storage, formats are defined in protocol definitions, which are themselves defined in the same type of data structures.  Although actors in the system could implement one or more protocols directly, being able to read them from a standard protocol definition gives greater flexibility - better serving the goals of interoperability between chains.

<h3>Block Assembly Tool</h3>

Protocol definitions are necessarily large and complex.  Defining the protocol through hand coded structure creations is remarkably cumbersome.  A graphic assembly tool facilitates easier comprehension of the structures.  Investment in the tool should enable faster and less error prone protocol and application development.
