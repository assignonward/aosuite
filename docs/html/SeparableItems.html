<span itemprop="articleBody">In an ideal, rational world, there would be no need for separable items.  No combination of bits on a computer is inherently dangerous, but... there are parts of the world governed by people who believe that some information should not be allowed to freely circulate in their jurisdiction.  Since a central concept of the <a href="BlockchainBasics.html">blockchain</a> includes public dissemination of a consistent global public record, it is inevitable that persons innocent or malicious will<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">illegally, or even legally</span></div> record something on the blockchain which is illegal in some jurisdiction.  Rather than attempt to fight local censorship laws or extend their reach globally, the Assign Onward blockchain incorporates the concept of "Separable Items" - items which are included in the blockchain by their hash, and thus can be separated (and censored) without impacting other portions of the blockchain's integrity checking.<br/><br/>

Without censorship considerations, the blockchain would be served in its entirety to all jurisdictions, but when certain information in the blockchain is objected to by certain jurisdictions, then servers outside those jurisdictions may provide a "scrubbed" blockchain which removes the offending data before sending blocks into the restrictive jursidictions.  Note that transactional data, such as public keys, share amounts and signatures, are not separable items and hopefully should not run afoul of censorship concerns.<br/><br/>

In the figure you can see how the separable items themselves are not included in the hashed data, but their hashes are.  Not quite a Merkle tree<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">without calculation of a nonce to worry about, the Merkle tree is sort of overkill in an Ⓐ protocol.  A simple list of separable item blocks with their associated list of hashes should be efficient and flexible in this setting.</span></div>, but similar.
