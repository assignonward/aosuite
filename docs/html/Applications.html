<span itemprop="articleBody">
<h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>

As long as speculative investors are willing to trade hard currency for shares in <a href="BlockchainBasics.html">blockchains</a>, <a href="SharesCoins.html">cryptocurrency</a> will be an interesting application.  Of course, the string of bits that makes up a blockchain isn't the really valuable part, it is the network of processors who make the blockchain extensible - alive if you will, and connected to people who are willing to trade cryptocurrency for things of value in the physical world.  With active processors and a reliable (trustable) blockchain, investors today continue to invest with great enthusiasm.  May the bubble never burst.

<h2>Coupons</h2>

Assets redeemable for specific items under specific terms.  They may be as broad as "spendable like cash" gift cards specific to a certain family of stores, or they may be as narrow as "a free cup of coffee at this location, Tuesdays between 9 and 11 am."<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">or, as described in <a href="IslandLife.html">Island Life</a> some coupons may only have value at unpredictable times and places, like Bob's curry goat grill cart - when Bob has some curry goat ready to sell.</span></div>  Making coupons available for share/transfer on worldwide electronic markets is an intriguing development that could lead to applications such as a GPS driven notifications of available deals at your current location.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">trading something of value that you have for a dodgy coupon is a lot less risky if you are at the location and time where you can redeem it more or less immediately.  Successful redemption can also be baked in as part of the exchange protocol, so whatever you have traded for the coupon doesn't actually transfer until the coupon is successfuly redeemed.</span></div>  Individuals could exchange coupons they have for coupons of higher value to them.  And, issuers of coupons could track the current float of coupons in the market, their <a href="Expiration.html">expiration</a> times, track how their coupons are traded and used, etc.

<h2><a href="ArtPatronage.html">Art Patronage</a></h2>

The world of digital art continues to struggle to inspire patrons to give digital artists the same level of backing that traditional painters, sculptors and other hard-media artists have enjoyed for centuries.  Conceivably, a digital work of art could be included in a <a href="BlockchainBasics.html#GenesisBlock">Genesis Block</a> and patrons could purchase shares of the work.  Problems of counterfeiting and duplication still, of course, exist - but if the artist maintains the integrity of their digital signature that should be a somewhat reliable sign to investors that they are, indeed, purchasing a quantifiable share of a genuine original work by the artist.  Shares in the work could be held openly, or anonymously, and similarly the amount paid for the shares would be optional to disclose.  Everyone, shareholder or not, would be free to enjoy the work, but only shareholders have "ownership" in the piece.  Pieces could be closely held, such as an image with a restriction to no more than 20 shareholders, or widely distributed like a song sold for $0.99 per share with 100 million shares available for purchase.

<h2>Social community news/message board</h2>

The same small world network which processes recording transactions could serve-up human friendly webpages which share news stories and comment/discussion threads related to those stories - all stored in a similar, or same fashion as blockchain records.  Some interesting possibilities for exchange of shares / ratings points, etc. become readily apparent, but all in all, identified users and anonymous ones should be able to use such a system, and propogate discussion threads to all nodes.

Users could vote with shares which stories to keep open for active discussion, which to store, and which to cycle out of archive storage after a period of months or years.

<h2>Flexible demand auction</h2>

Say you are an "in-demand" speaker like an ex-president or some such.  You might set up a marketplace where you sell "speaking shares" to the open market.  You tell the world that you will go to speaking engagements at least twice a year, and you will be selling up to 200 speaking shares per year.  After each speaking engagement, whatever venue is offering you the most speaking shares to come to them next is the one you will book next.  When you book the engagement, that venue's speaking shares comes back to the speaker who is free to offer them back out to the market for "valuable consideration," whenever and however the speaker chooses to.  You might donate a few shares to your alma-mater every year, a few more to your city government, and put the rest out for auction, after each share sells at auction, the next share demands twice the price of the previous one.  Your alma mater and city government can use their gifted shares to compete (unfairly?) with paying bidders, or they can sell their shares on the open market as a source of income.  Venues which miss out on one speaking engagement might accumulate shares over time when they are at low price points, or they might sell their shares off - possibly for a profit.  Of course, speculators can play the market.

<h2>Many more</h2>

<ul><li>Educational records - verifiable with the institution</li>
    <ul><li>B.S. degrees (M.S. Mfa, PhD, HS diploma, Third grade honors in Art, etc.)</li>
        <li>Food safety courses</li>
        <li>Whatever might apply to services the person is providing</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Credibility weighted customer satisfaction ratings</li>
    <li>Anything a service provider might want to share with a potential customer, verifiable by trusted outside sources</li>
    <li>Potentially, anything required by law for a service provider to share with a potential customer</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=blockchain+applications">Unlimited</a></h2>

When ICO market caps started registering in billions of USD, businesses began buying into blockchain, bigtime.  Lacking a central "hook" that is attempting to control, centralize or concentrate profits in any particular place, the Assign Onward blockchain implementation should appeal less to ventures with visions of dominating the world, and more to low investment, small entities and businesses that use blockchain(s) for their own purposes and profit.
