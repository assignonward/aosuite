<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>Enumerated, small, testable descriptions of functionality, guided by the <a href="CorePrinciples.html">Core Principles</a>, and mixed with implementation decisions that, while not specifically required to fulfill the core principles, do serve to fulfill the requirements and provide a defined solution.</p>

<ul>
    <li>R1: A <a href="Signatures.html">signature</a> is a data collection which includes:</li>
    <ul><li>R1a: The <a href="Numbers.html#Time">time</a> the signature was generated.</li>
        <li>R1b: A recognized and identified cryptographic signature of the entire data item being signed, with any <a href="SeparableItems.html">separable items</a> replaced by recognized and identified hashes of the potentially separated items,<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">In the event that an item is separated, it must be replaced with this same hash which was used to compute the signature.</span></div> and the time of signature from R1a appended.</li>
        <li>R1c: A reference to what is being signed, for example: a participant index in an assignment agreement.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>R2: A signature may be computed using any<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">As constrained by the item key type's definition, for instance the AO_ECDSA_SIG key indicates an ECDSA signature using brainpool256 curve and Sha2-256 hash replacements for separable items.</span></div> cryptographic signature algorithm recognized by the protocol implementation.</li>
    <ul><li>R2a: Ⓐ1 protocol recognizes ECDSA brainpool-256 and RSA3072 signature types.</li>
        <li>R2b: Ⓐ1 protocol expects all signature types to use Sha2-256 hash for separable items.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Future protocols may identify different signature keys which still use the same ECDSA and RSA signature computations but use a different hash for separable items.</span></div></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>R3: A hash may be computed using any<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">As constrained by the item key type's definition, for instance the AO_ECDSA_SIG key indicates an ECDSA signature using brainpool256 curve and Sha2-256 hash replacements for separable items.</span></div> cryptographic algorithm recognized by the protocol implementation.</li>
    <ul><li>R3a: Ⓐ1 protocol recognizes Sha2-256 and Sha3-512 hash types.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>R4: <a href="AssignmentAgreement.html">Assignment agreements</a> are structured into AO_AUTHORIZATION collections as described in the linked document, including:</li>
    <ul><li>R4a: Valid AO_AUTH_SIG signature data collections as described in R1 for every participant in the R4b1 AO_ASSIGNMENT, signing the AO_ASGN_HASH from R4b2 plus the time of signing.</li>
        <li>R4b: An AO_ASSIGN_COMPLETE data collection, including:</li>
        <ul><li>R4b1: an AO_ASSIGNMENT containing:
            <ul><li>R4b1a: All Giver participants, which include:</li>
                <ul><li>R4b1a1: AO_ID_SEQ_NUM of the giver<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">A reference to the public ID of the giver, as well as the AO_AMT of shares that ID controls, and the current UTXO database should indicate if those shares are still available for assignment onward.</span></div></li>
                    <li>R5b1a2: AO_INDEX unique identifier of the participant within this transaction<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">for later matching with their signature in the authorization.</span></div></li>
                </ul>
                <li>R4b1b: All Receiver participants, which include:</li>

                    <li>R4b1b2: AO_AMT number of shares being received in this assignment.</li>

                </ul>
                <li>R4b1c: AO_RECORDING_BID - all receiver AO_AMTs plus the AO_RECORDING_BID must match the amount of shares referred to by the Givers' AO_ID_SEQ_NUM.</li>
                <li>R4b1d: AO_RECORDING_DEADLINE - time by which this assignment must be recorded to be binding.</li>
                <li>R4b1e: AO_LISTSIZE - number of givers and receivers in the assignment (redundant, check info).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>R4b2: an AO_ASGN_HASH hash of the AO_ASSIGNMENT in R4b1:
