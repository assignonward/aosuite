<span itemprop="articleBody">The Asset Organizer is the end user facing aspect of the Assign Onward software suite.  It organizes lists of secret keys and underwriter contact addresses, presents the user with summary data about the current state of the secret key titles (values in coins), and facilitates negotiation and execution of assignment contracts.  A user will likely have more than one Asset Organizer (desktop, cellphone, spouse's cellphone, [shudder] cloud copy), they can attempt to communicate with each other directly to update status, but the ultimate check of share title status comes when contacting an underwriter to verify on the blockchain.</span></span>

<span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" itemref="_name1"><h2 itemprop="articleSection" id="Secrets">Secrets</h2>
<span itemprop="articleBody">All the usual secret keeping advice applies.  Some strategies specifically applicable to an asset organizer include: division of assets into multiple "accounts" with different passphrases which compartamentalizes for damage control in the event of passphrase "leaking," backups on multiple devices in multiple physical locations, long-lasting identities (public/private key pairs) on each wallet device so they can synchronize new assets securely, etc.</span></span>

<span itemprop="articleBody">IP address to contact other asset organizers<div class="tooltip"><sup>1</sup><span class="tooltiptext">both shared accounts for off-chain sharing and others' accounts for on chain assignments</span></div> and underwriters at.  Usually will include long lasting public key ids as well as user facing name and other helpful information.</span></span>

Asset organizers that communicate with each other can share updated status from a single underwriter contact.<div class="tooltip"><sup>3</sup><span class="tooltiptext">This does raise an interesting feature of information source tracking, which should be addressed in the network interface layer.</span></div></span></span>
