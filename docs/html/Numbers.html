<h2>Big and Bigger</h2>

Within the AO protocol, all counted things are represented by integers and rational fractions aka the ratio of two integers.  Internally, these integers are represented by 64 bit signed integers, or when that's not big enough, by arbitrarily large integers handled by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">GMP</a> library.<br/><br/>

Floating point numbers may be used in user interface representations of rational fractions, but the actual internal calculations are done to obtain exact results which can be exactly duplicated on a wide variety of hardware and software which may be checking the calculations.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Originally, 128 bit integers were considered for the larger numbers, but even those are too small for some reasonable applications, and they are also problematic when porting to various computer architectures - the GMP library, while cumbersome, is more portable than __int128.</span></div>

<h2>Storage</h2>

Both 64 bit integers and GMP integers are stored in key-value form where a 64 bit key<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">stored as variable length byte code</span></div> preceeds the data, with the data format indicated by the key value: variable length byte code for 64 bit integers, or the byte encoded form of a GMP integer or rational fraction.<br/><br/>

When 64 bit integers are stored, they are always stored as signed variable length byte code.  Small numbers between -64 and 64 are stored in a single byte<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">in this variable length byte code, the least significant bit indicates the number sign: 1 = negative</span></div>, two bytes increases the range to +/-8192 and the range continues increasing by 7 bits per byte in the code, with the 8th bit in each byte indicating whether or not this byte is the last in the code.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">when the most significant bit in a byte is set, then the next byte is also part of the value.  In variable length byte code, values are stored least significant bits first.</span></div>  Extremely large numbers take 9 or sometimes 10 bytes to store, but on average the storage space is greatly decreased, especially for smaller numbers.<br/><br/>

GMP integers are stored as byte codes with the most significant byte first, with a variable length byte code telling the number of bytes used to store the integer.  Rational fractions are stored as two integers, with two variable length byte encoded sizes: the first telling the size of the remaining size code plus the size of both integers<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">total bytes remaining in the object, as is standard for all variable sized objects</span></div> followed by a variable length byte encoded size of the numerator storage, followed by the numerator and denominator.  The most significant bit of these stored GMP integers indicates the sign: 1 is negative (and ignored for magnitude) and 0 is positive.  When necessary, a most significant byte is prepended to the stored integer to achieve the required sign bit.

<h1>Time</h1>

Time is expressed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time#Encoding_time_as_a_number">Unix Time</a> encoded in a signed 64 bit integer, with the seconds multiplied by 189,000,000.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">this encoding places the storage value rollover event approximately 1,500 years in the future.</span></div>  The 189,000,000<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Why 189?  189 is 3x3x3x7, enabling even division by any number up to 10, and many more common larger numbers.</span></div> divisions are used to ensure that events generated on a single server are given a strictly increasing sequence in time - while events coming from multiple sources may be recorded as simultaneous, no two events recorded by a single actor may be marked as simultaneous.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#Leap_seconds">leap second concerns</a> the only rule for AO protocol is that events must be sequential in represented time.  One might condsider a leap second to be a brief trading halt, or if one must trade during the leap second, the software must simply assure monotonically increasing time numbers for all time records.</span></div>  It is expected that actual clock times accurate to the millisecond will be used, and for events which are generated in the same millisecond of clock time, their timestamps will be adjusted to place them in proper sequence when considering the smaller divisions of time.  When time values are stored, they are stored as straight 8 byte big endian storage of the integer.
